# Responsive-CSS-Grid
Aiming to develop the lightest responsive css grid for cross browsers.

<ul>
<li>row: .row class can be used to divide your webpages into a number of segment. Inside the row class you have to create the responsive css grid. You can divide the row into a number of columns as per as your need.</li>
<li>column: based on medica screen we brought 5 types of column class
	<ul>
		<li>l - Large column</li>
		<li>m - Medium column</li>
		<li>sm - Small Medium column</li>
		<li>s - Small column</li>
		<li>sx - Super Small column</li>
	</ul>
	We maintained a 12 column grid. To divide a row into 2 equal size grid you can use - 
	<div class="row">
	<div class="l-6 s-12"></div>
	<div class="l-6 s-12"></div>
	</div>
</ul>
